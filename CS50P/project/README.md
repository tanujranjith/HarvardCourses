    #### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/Ey0TNlyUrgU>
    #### Description:The project aims to assist incoming Harvard students in finding suitable housing options during their time on campus. The process involves utilizing a Python script called "project.py" to sort the new students into different housing situations. The script utilizes various criteria such as preferences, availability, and compatibility to determine the best fitting house for each student.Once the sorting process is complete, the information of all the successfully assigned students is recorded in a file named "after.csv". This file serves as a record of the housing assignments and allows for easy reference and tracking.To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the sorting algorithm, a separate file named "test_project.py" is provided. This file is specifically designed to test the functionality of the original sorting script, ensuring that it functions as intended and produces reliable results.To provide comprehensive information and guidance to users, a "readme.md" file is included in the project. This file contains a video link where users can find a detailed demonstration of the project's functionality. Additionally, the readme.md file provides a description of the project, explaining its purpose, features, and any specific instructions or requirements.In order to personalize the project and cater to individual needs, a file called "details" is included. This file allows users to input their own place of residency and provides a space to customize the project's title according to their preferences.Lastly, the "new_students.csv" file is where all the necessary information for new students is stored. This file serves as an input for the project, containing data such as student preferences, requirements, and any other relevant details needed for the sorting process.By combining these various components, the project aims to streamline the housing assignment process for Harvard students, ensuring that they find suitable accommodation that aligns with their preferences and needs while studying on campus.
